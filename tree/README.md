# Tree Concept

A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes. Each node contains a value and zero or more child nodes. The topmost node is called the root node.

## Perfect Tree

A perfect tree is a tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level. A perfect tree is a special type of binary tree.

## Complete Tree

A complete tree is a tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A complete tree is a special type of binary tree.

## Full Tree

A full tree is a tree in which every node has exactly two children. A full tree is a special type of binary tree.

## BST - Binary search tree

Go left if your value is smaller than the current branch.
Go right if your value is bigger.
